# Intrusion detection system

An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is a security mechanism that analyzes network traffic and notifies administrators when it detects potentially unauthorized or malicious activities. OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, provides tools for image processing, object detection, and tracking.  

In the context of video surveillance, OpenCV can be utilized to monitor and analyze video footage, identifying potential security threats such as unauthorized access to restricted zones or unusual behavior in public spaces.
